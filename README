The game of SET
----------------

This is a personal project and is currently in the works. More coming soon!

Definition:
    A SET consists of three cards on which each individual feature is either all the same OR all different on all three cards.

For details on how this game works, see http://www.setgame.com/set

What's done so far?
    I've implemented a card class for the game of SET, with some helpers:
    * isSET - determines if 3 cards is a valid SET (satifying the definition below)
    * getMatchingCard - get the matching card that would complete a SET, given 2 cards. This will be helpful in the future when trying to decide what card is needed to complete a SET, when looking for sets on the Board.

What's next?
    Create a Deck to hold all unique 81 SET cards.
    Create a Board to represent the playing field.
    Allow humans to play.
    Polish with some GUI.
